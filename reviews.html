                <p class="review-card__text">
                  Really very rarely write reviews but this cream works. I’ve been dealing with adult acne for 4 years
                  now. It started
                  when I switched to an iud for birth control and I have tried everything, even going to a
                  dermatologist. Nothing worked
                  on my chin and cheek area...until this. I went from waking up to a new pimple everyday to searching my
                  face for where
                  the next one will pop up...but it doesn’t. I still have the occasional small bump but only one has
                  developed into a
                  white head in the two weeks since I’ve started using this product. The only thing to note is that I
                  highly recommend a
                  moisturizer to go along with this cream as it’s definitely drying. I also upped my sunscreen usage as
                  may face turns red
                  a lot more easily.

                  These are a game changer. Very satisfied!
                  They didn’t work with some zits that hadn’t fully surfaced yet but other than that they were amazing.
                  I bought them
                  because I had a painful zit on my nose that was huge and wouldn’t fully drain (sorry for the gross
                  details) no matter
                  how hard I/my friend tried. So I bought these and left it on overnight. I was worried bc the skin had
                  gotten torn up
                  when I tried to pop it myself, so I was scared it would do something gross. I woke up and it was GONE.
                  There was a huge
                  white dot in the sticker and it even managed to get the core. Since then, I’ve tried it on smaller
                  problem spots and it
                  works wonders. It even draws stuff out of surrounding pores that I didn’t even know were issues.

                  Loving loving loving
                  I love what this product does for my hair. I have 3C hair, for you curly gals. I had to stop dying my
                  hair 3 years ago
                  after a severe allergic reaction. We’re talking emergency room visit!! My hair can be course, dry and
                  frizzy. I’ve been
                  using an excellent oil shampoo and conditioner and coconut oil to style and a flat iron, but still
                  needed something else
                  to help restore my hair. And so the hunt began. Almost all the products had a lot of chemicals which I
                  wanted to avoid.
                  And then I found this product. So happy I did. Never used a hair mask before, but when I saw the
                  healthy list of
                  ingredients thought I’d give it a try. I’m using it 2x a week after shampooing. I use an ample amount
                  and then comb
                  through my hair putting a shower cap on and time it for 45 minutes. Wash it out and blow dry leaving
                  my hair silky and
                  shiny. Great product that I will continue to use knowing how healthy it is to restore and make
                  manageable my hair. Just
                  try it!!! I’m on my second jar and product has been improved. It looks, feels, smells and works even
                  better than my
                  first jar. Love love love it. Thank you for making a great hair product without chemicals that
                  actually works!!!

                  Amazing)
                  I originally purchased the hair mask of this brand because it has a ton of raving reveiws. Later I
                  bought acne free
                  cream and I love how smooth this cream feels when applied. I use a generous amount and my face doesn't
                  feel overly oily.
                  Slight tingle and warmth which I like bc it makes me feel it's actually working. Could be used as a
                  spot treatment or
                  entire facial moisturizer. Within a week I saw major improvements. Its been about a month and my face
                  has seriously
                  healed so much. Thank you for tips which included in the package, because I have also stopped the
                  habit of popping
                  pimples or black heads. This plays a significant role in the healing process. It's very hard not to
                  but it truly helps
                  eliminate the spreading.

                  5 of 5! Life Saver!!!
                  I am almost 30, and have struggled with adult acne for over 10 years. I have used every single product
                  ever created. I
                  see a dermatologist for prescription grade products, and STILL have acne. These little patches have
                  FINALLY given me
                  relief to my stubborn pimples. You can literally SEE all the junk it pulls out the pimple. I get those
                  HUGE ones pop up
                  under the skin. The first night I put a patch on it, it decreases it to half the size! By the second
                  or third night it
                  is completely gone!!! I have learned the trick to fully getting everything out, is to run a hand towel
                  under HOT water,
                  then hold on the pimple for at least a minute to open up the pore. Then place the patch over the area,
                  and by morning it
                  pulls everything out! I also tried a cheaper brand of these with more in the pack, and that was a
                  total waste of money.
                  You most definitely get what you pay for.

                  Best moisturizing acne treatment!!!!!
                  I have used many acne treatments in the past and they have either not worked, irritated my skin , or
                  would take forever
                  to work and then cause more acne . I struggle with acne mainly on my chin area and sometimes on my jaw
                  line and i was so

                  Amazing! It works!
                  I’m a 47 year old woman who has adult cystic acne for 12 years. 4 months ago I got the worst cystic
                  zit of my life. It
                  kept closing up and then refilling. I was so depressed and researched these dots online and was amazed
                  how great they
                  work! They were able to drain the zit and keep it draining so it couldn’t close and refill and get big
                  and angry. Get
                  these! Seriously they really were a GOD send!

                  A little goes a long way
                  I've been using this cream for a week now and have already seen a visible improvement in how
                  "inflamed" my skin is (or
                  isn't) looking. It's smooth, goes on easy, absorbs quickly and has a nice mild scent. The acne cream I
                  was using before
                  this didn't absorb and left a sticky residue that would make my face stick to my pillow at night so
                  this is such a vast
                  improvement from that, I am grateful that I came across it! Definitely recommend. Love that it can be
                  used as a general
                  cream as well as for spot treatment - I have been doing both.

                  Satisfied!!!
                  I was skeptical but held out hope based on reviews... I was worried to use it for my oily face skin
                  would make it worse!
                  After months and months of bad hormonal outbreaks, i gave this product a try and was SO PLEASANTLY
                  SURPRISED. I had
                  cystic acne, blackheads galore, and regular acne often. This product helps me keep all that in control
                  and I RARELY
                  break out, just a little guy here and there. CAN'T RECOMMEND ENOUGH!!

                  I was expecting a great result after reading a bunch of reviews here but the actual result surpassed
                  all my
                  expectations, amazing product for a great price value, definitely ordering more in the future! I used

                  Loving it
                  Honestly I was skeptical to buy this because I thought 15 pounds for a 2oz cream was ridiculous but I
                  read alot of
                  reviews and decided to get it. I can now say I definitely do not regret this buy. I've only been using
                  it for a week and
                  I haven't really had any acne (I usually have a white head somewhere on my face) and the redness on my
                  cheeks and
                  forehead have decreased a ton which I love. I use it once-twice a day and though thr container is
                  small I don't need to
                  use a lot for my entire face so it should last a while. It moisturizes my face, clears up acne and
                  reddness, and doesn't
                  require a ton of cream at once. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone and will definitely
                  buy again!

                  Hormonal, cystic acne miracle worker!
                  I suffer from really bad hormonal and cystic acne. I was super skeptical about buying this product
                  because I’ve bought
                  hundreds of products and none work in the long run. However, just a few days after using this acne
                  cream my face has
                  seriously changed!!! The acne is disappearing and my skin is not dry or worse. It’s only been a couple
                  of weeks, but I
                  will definitely keep buying this product!! It’s a miracle worker and I hope you never discontinue it
                  !! Maybe soon I’ll
                  be able to take pictures again without having to cover up with makeup.

                  Best hair mask for colored hair!
                  I was very skeptic of ordering this because I have colored hair and don’t want the color to fade. But
                  I’m very
                  impressed! The packaging is super cute and the brush that it comes with is my favorite. My hair is so
                  soft and shiny
                  after the first use! The scent of the hair mask smells beyond amazing! I used the brush while I had
                  the hair mask on and
                  brushed throughout my hair. The color in my hair looks amazing as well! Definitely purchasing again!

                <p class="review-card__text">
                  This is a real deal!
                  These little pimple patches work great!! The hydrocolloid works as advertised, sucking out the pus
                  from whiteheads so I
                  don't have to squeeze or scar the pimple. I've tried other patches and these are similar with few
                  differences:
                  First of all of these patches are the same size. Other brands have multiple sizes in one pack but I
                  noticed that a lot
                  of them are too small so they go to waste. The big ones are too big, which also seems like a waste.
                  Patches safisa size
                  is just perfect.
                  Secondly, these are stickier than other brands. Sometimes I would leave on other patches overnight but
                  they'd slide off
                  by the time morning came. I tried this one overnight and it was right where I left it the night
                  before!
                  There are a lot of similar patches out there but this one really hits the sweet spot with the size and
                  stickiness

                <p class="review-card__text">
                  Good for refreshing skin
                  This product is a great addition to any skin care regimen. In my case I used it as a replacement for a
                  more severe type
                  of medication that I felt I could phase away from in exchange for something lighter and healthier for
                  my skin. In the
                  beginning I was hesitant that this would do the trick, but I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised
                  and am continuing
                  to use it on a daily basis with now a few weeks away from the harsher medication. Overall, I will say
                  that my intuitive
                  impression from using this cream is that it is actually beneficial for the skin, and is definitely
                  helpful in
                  maintaining a clear complexion. It leaves you feeling like you're doing something to prevent a
                  possible breakout, and
                  yet you're not digging yourself into another hole by overdoing it and going to war with your skin.
                  It's simply a good
                  balance and I think that if you've been plagued with acne and feel the need to consistently include
                  something in your
                  regimen to keep it under control, this is a good bet.

                  Actually works!
                  I wish I could give it 10 stars. I have BIG cystic acne. I recently had several cysts injected at the
                  dermatologist and
                  use creams which he advised. Tried EVERYTHING- im 33 and have been dealing with this for years and
                  years. I had never
                  even heard of these patches until recently and decided why the heck not. Ok friends, they WORK LIKE A
                  MIRACLE. In just a
                  few hours I had to change one out because it had already turned white with puss (this was one more of
                  a whitehead, but
                  still big and cystic). Most of my jawline cysts are actually tiny right now but still red and hard and
                  ugly and painful,
                  and after using a patch on 2 of them overnight they are FLAT. SERIOUSLY, i cant believe it.

                  Worth trying
                  I bought this cream for my teen daughter to help with her breakouts, scarring, redness and
                  inflammations. Wanted to wait
                  a while before posting my review to make sure this product is work. Within a week I had noted a
                  difference... the acne
                  was not as severe and the redness and inflammation were gone. Within two months my teens face skin
                  looks so much better
                  with hardly any acne breakouts and no more redness and inflammation. However this product has worked
                  amazingly and my
                  teen is very happy with it. My teen puts this product on after each face washing morning and night.

                  It works!!
                  I have had cystic hormonal acne since I was 12 and honestly this helped so much in only a matter of 2
                  weeks. It dries
                  out any bumps you may have picked at and reduced any redness i had in a matter of hours. Couldn’t be
                  happier with this
                  product.

                  It's amazing!!!
                  This product is amazing!!! I have damaged my hair this year bleaching then using crappy store bough
                  dye on top of it.
                  Then using a flat iron everyday damaged my hair. I wanted to try coco and eve but it was so expensive
                  I couldn't order
                  it. I found this and wanted to try it since it is all natural. It worked in one use!!! I couldn't
                  believe it!!! The only
                  complaint I have is the brush I received has a gap between where the bristles are and the handle and
                  over time mold
                  could build up in the brush. It's not a big deal though a wide tooth comb will do the same thing. I
                  have fine frizzy
                  wild damaged hair and after using a hot brush dryer on it I looked like I came out of a salon!!!

                  Working well!
                  I never suffered from acne until covid hit and we had to start wearing masks everywhere. This stuff is
                  magic! Once you
                  put it on pimple you feel pulsating and the cream's doing its job. Its fast acting and has literally
                  shrunken bumps
                  overnight that appeared the day before. I also combine the use of this with acne free cream by this
                  brand. I'm on my
                  second jar! I just wished it was a bit bigger but no complaints about the product itself. I absolutely
                  love it and I'm
                  so glad that there's s product out there for troublesome skin!

                  Hair is SUPER soft
                  My dry hair needed this! It is so damaged due to stripping from coloring so I needed something to help
                  fix that. This
                  did the trick! Also, it comes with a little brush to help spread the conditioner through your hair
                  (I've always only
                  used my hands) and I can honestly say I did not think it would make a difference but it did. I felt
                  like it got to every
                  strand. My hair literally shines. I highly recommend this if you have dry , damaged hair.

                  Must have for sensitive skin
                  I broke out on my chin with cystic acne a week before my wedding . Freaking out i tried popping them
                  and only made
                  things much worse. My skin became very raw and red. My skin was burning and oozing. I found this
                  safisa product and it
                  arrived after 3 days. I started using it immediately. I have very sensitive skin and some products
                  make my face so much
                  worse but this didn’t. I love how fast my skin absorbed. I noticed a huge difference the next morning.
                  The bumps shrunk
                  and there was less redness . My skin was healing . Within three days my skin was almost cleared. The
                  best thing about it
                  was when my cystic acne shrunk and my skin healed i didn’t have those pesky dark spots. I highly
                  recommend this product
                  .

                  Amazing! Better ingredients than another masks!
                  Absolutely wonderful. This mask is intensely hydrating, has a nice but not too strong coconut smell,
                  and leaves my hair
                  SUPER soft and shiny. It boasts the usual no parabens or sulfates, but UNLIKE its more expensive Coco
                  & Eve counterpart,
                  it also excludes two other ingredients that are no good for your hair: alcohols (which dry out the
                  hair) and
                  dimethicones (which coat the individual hairs in a silicone that makes it FEEL softer & more
                  moisturized initially, but
                  gradually builds up and causes dullness & a weight that kills volume). The brush is rather useless
                  with my long curly
                  hair, but that’s okay, I have a similar full-handled detangling brush that does the job just fine. All
                  in all, I can
                  confidently say YOU NEED THIS MASK!!

                  Does the job.
                  I’ve been using this product for about three months. It works great on getting rid of acne. Now, mine
                  is pretty
                  persistent and gets worse during a certain time of the month. But this is keeping it at bay.. I put it
                  on THICK. I don’t
                  rub it in to the point that it cakes up. However it’s not that you can see lotion on my face either.
                  Wash face. Toner
                  (which hazel) then this acne cream. Another products seemed to break me out more without giving me
                  results even after
                  months of using it. I suspected the initial break out but I didn’t get that with this cream. It smells
                  clean, it feels
                  moisturizing, and it keeps breakouts away! I do get one every 1-2 months. Now if only I could accept
                  the fact that my
                  face is clearer and I don’t have anything to pick at!

                  I really love this stuff!
                  I think that this is a great product. I've got combination, sensitive skin and I got a lot of little
                  white heads when I
                  started using it. It felt nice going on, and wasn't greasy. Pimple cream just pulled out all pimples
                  so I can feel that
                  my skin is finally clear.

                  LOVE IT
                  I have been wanting to try similar hair mask for a while now but I didn’t want to spend the money. I
                  eventually found
                  this product and saw how great the reviews were. I wanted to try it for myself, not to mention the
                  price was very
                  reasonable. I love this hair mask. I don’t think my hair has ever been this soft before. My frizz is
                  gone but it also
                  does not make my hair oily. I definitely recommend this hair mask.

                  Witchcraft)))
                  I have sensitive skin and hormonal acne on my chin. Yeah for me. I break out monthly, especially
                  around that time of
                  month. This past month, my acne break out was the worst it’s ever been. Mainly because I took a week
                  trip to a different
                  climate where it was sunny and humid, and returned to a cold snow storm. My skin did not take that
                  change well. I had
                  6-7 big whitehead pimples on my chin. The kind that are perfect for popping but will take awhile to
                  heal. I normally get
                  1-3 good ones during this time so to have this many was concerning. I ordered these and put them on
                  last night. Wore
                  overnight for about 8-9hours and woke up this morning surprised. It dried up the ones I didn’t pop
                  without drying up my
                  skin. It absorbed the pimple! Witchcraft. For the ones that I did pop and put them over, they
                  expedited the healing.
                  Again...witchcraft?

                  Truly works best product ever!
                  The product worked way better then expected. My face when done felt like never before soft and smooth.
                  If u are looking
                  for a treatment I will recommend that you try this one. I have used many in the past without results.
                  This is the only
                  one tht has made a visual difference in the first day. Day after day my face got incredibly better.
                  Thanks so much!!!
