          We must receive full cleared payment for an order before we despatch the goods. You can pay using any major
          credit or
          debit card. You confirm that the credit or debit card that is being used is yours. All credit or debit
          cardholders are
          subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to
          authorise
          payment, we wonâ€™t be liable for any delay or non-delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="buyers__info">
          All prices shown are inclusive of VAT at current rates and are exclusive of delivery charges. The total cost
          of your
          order is the price of the goods ordered and delivery charges as set out in the delivery section of our
          website.
        </p>
        <p class="buyers__info">
          We may not accept your order if an item you have ordered is out of stock, we are unable to obtain
          authorisation for your
          payment or if there is a product or pricing error. We reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase by you
          at any
          time. No contract will be formed unless and until SAFISA accepts the Buyers order. Acceptance will be deemed
          to have
          occurred when SAFISA sends a confirmatory email to the Buyer, or if earlier, SAFISA dispatches the Goods.
        </p>
        <p class="buyers__info">
          If we are unable to fulfil your order following our order acknowledgement, we will contact you by email or
          telephone
          advising you of this. Our cancellation and return procedures are set in another section.
