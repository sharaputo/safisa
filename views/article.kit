            Stop Word: Suspicious Cosmetic Ingredients

            Gone are the days when girls bought beautiful jars with the words
            "eco-bio-organic" for a beautiful photo on Instagram. There is no
            more excitement around natural cosmetics. A different era has come
            when it is no longer necessary to loudly and colorfully expose the
            sins of paraben-glycol creams. The girls grew up and realized that
            the main thing is not a jar, but its contents, that cunning
            manufacturers have a reason to skillfully disguise toxic
            components under beautiful names and labels (yes, under this very
            "eco-bio"), that there is a reason to carefully study the
            composition of the cream or masks before trying them on yourself.
            And there are at least five reasons to choose natural cosmetics
            instead of regular ones.
          </p>
          <h2>Reason one: pharmaceutical</h2>
          <p>
            Most of the documents regulating cosmetic production still
            describe cosmetics as products that do not penetrate deeper than
            the stratum corneum of the skin. Old textbooks on cosmetology and
            dermatology use the thesis about the impermeability of the skin,
            approve the use of chemicals in the composition of cosmetics with
            a large size of molecules that "lie on the surface and are not
            absorbed", in other words, create an occlusive film. This approach
            was formed in the middle of the twentieth century and,
            unfortunately, has not yet been revised at the legislative level,
            and given how many cosmetic corporations are tied in their
            industries on this very approach, it is unlikely that they will
            gather to lobby for the revision of official papers in the near
            future.

            But the accumulated scientific data over the past 10-15 years has
            forced a serious rethink of the issue of skin permeability, and
            this happened thanks to pharmacists. Today, there are more and
            more medicinal transdermal drugs, those that affect the body by
            penetrating through the skin. For example, popular nicotine
            patches, patches with a powerful painkiller, which are used even
            for cancer patients, patches-contraceptives. And if you add to
            this the fact that, according to research, even petroleum products
            with their large molecules, applied to the skin, after a couple of
            hours form a kind of "depot", through which they still penetrate
            into the deep layers of the skin and then into the bloodstream.
            The theory of the impenetrability of the skin begins to crack at
            the seams.
